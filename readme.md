# The University of I

## Overview

This repository is a space for self-directed learning, both in programming and programming-related subjects.

I'm using it as a testing lab to test out AZP pipelines for a project at work.

## Questions

* Is it possible to run a pipeline from its JSON export?
* How do you get a YAML representation of a pipeline?
* Is it possible to trigger a build only on changes to a given subfolder?

## Research

* [Azure DevOps Services REST API Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1)
* [Using Path filters in Build definition in Azure DevOps / VSTS](https://mohitgoyal.co/2018/09/19/using-path-filters-in-build-definition-in-azure-devops-vsts/)
