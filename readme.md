# The University of I

## Overview

This repository is a space for self-directed learning, both in programming and programming-related subjects.

I'm using it as a testing lab to test out AZP pipelines for a project at work.

## Questions

* Is it possible to run a pipeline from its JSON export?
* How do you get a YAML representation of a pipeline?
* Is it possible to trigger a build only on changes to a given subfolder?

## Research

* [ng new](https://angular.io/cli/new)
* [Angular ng build](https://angular.io/cli/build)
* [Running `ng build` in a specific directory](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50046729/running-ng-build-in-a-specific-directory)
