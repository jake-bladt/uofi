# The University of I

## Overview

This repository is a space for self-directed learning, both in programming and programming-related subjects.

I'm using it as a testing lab to test out AZP pipelines for a project at work.

## Questions

* Is it possible to run a pipeline from its JSON export?
* How do you get a YAML representation of a pipeline?
* Is it possible to trigger a build only on changes to a given subfolder?
