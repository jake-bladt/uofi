# Thoughts on an ongoing curriculum for 2022

## Flow-of-consciousness notes on what to learn next

Because of career direction and the interruptions of the pandemic, 2021 has been a relatively low-code year. What serious code I've written has been in C# and JavaScript with a little bit of Python. I haven't worked with a major framework in a while, but I expect I could reacquire Angular skills without having to start from scratch.

Ironically, my year as a "DevOps engineer" has left what I think of as my "DevOps skills" in serious disrepair.
