# Day 12-13

## Storage

* S3 Glacier does not allow user tags or even names to the archives placed in Glacier. There may be room for a tool here.
* S3-related IAM policies can use object tags to treat files in a single bucket as if they had a file-system hierarchy.
* I still don't know what AWS Glue is
* There's some mushiness between my understanding of Elastic Block Store and Elastic File Store
* File gateway: On-premise NFS -> S3
* Splunk?
* Backing up volumes uses a "ghost copy protocol." The volumes do not have to be taken offline

* Possible deep dive: CORS policy, particularly with static websites hosted in S3
