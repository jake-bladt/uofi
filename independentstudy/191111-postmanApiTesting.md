# Notes on API testing in Postman

## Goals

* Primary: Write a series of developer ad hoc tests in Postman to determine if my feature to not return corrupted files from CarFS works correctly.
* Leverage this knowledge to test the settings API in IDP Manager.
* Automate the tests above to run with each build in Azure DevOps.
