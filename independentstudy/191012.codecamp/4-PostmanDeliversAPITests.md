# Code Camp 2019 Notes

## Session 4: Postman for API testing

Turning off Persist Variable Values keeps Postman from sharing your secrets.

PostMan samples save server responses within the context of a request.

Postman is fully scriptable and its tests can run both unattended and as part of a CI build context.

(RestSharp in place of a mature C# HTTP Client)

Unintelligible notes about npm package that can be used to automate PostMan tests. See https://www.getpostman.com/automated-testing to figure out what that was.
