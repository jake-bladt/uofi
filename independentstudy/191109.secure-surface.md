# Notes on Securing the Surface

One of the outstanding tasks I've had for myself was to secure the Surface tablet I bought second-hand on eBay. It's been working well, but it came with a default user (no password) and, if I'm going to put SSH keys for getting into VMs on it, I need to be able to lock/logout of it.

I started the process this morning, hoping it would be straightforward enough that I could bring the tablet with me while grocery shopping. Fate (and Windows Update) made that impossible, but it did turn out to be straightforward. Going into the "Friends and Family" section and logging in with my Microsoft account as if I were about to add other users was enough to eliminate the anonymous "User."

Googlebinging "Windows 10 Add User" gave this information on the results page without having to follow any links.

Interesting post-action note: I'm still User to the the system. Since this means I get to keep all my settings and installations, this feels like the right way to do things.
