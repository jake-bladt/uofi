## Notes

I've had an interest in Nix since the first presentation I saw at NYLUG back in 2018. My interest in it is primarily as a package manager to allow for building repeatable VMs using idempotent configuration files. Tonight's presentation was largely about using it as a substitte for docker.

My main takeaway was that it can be used as a substitute for docker.
