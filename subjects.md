# Concept: Subjects System

## Overview

Rather than attempting to follow the structured curriculum of a four-year college, the user can freely add subjects to their curriculum and track their progress in those subjects. This is done by tracking materials and notes.

## "User Stories"

Once a user is in the UofI system, they can add a subject they wish to track as well as materials and notes. Aging by subject is tracked with the aging reset every time a material is marked as completed or a note is added. Similarly, the user can assign themself projects to complete in the subject. Completion of the project will also reset subject aging.

At any time, a user can mark the subject they're following as "complete" or "inactive."
